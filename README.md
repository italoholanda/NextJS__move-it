# MOVE IT

This project consists in an gamified platform that stimulate the practice of exercises during the dev's work routine.

## How it works

1 - You can start the 25-minute timer to focus (like the Pomodoro app);

2 - After finishing, you receive a new challenge;

3 - You can honestly indicate whether it finished or failed;

4 - If you failed, you can start a new timer without XP gain;

5 - When you finish the challenge, you will gain some XP and level up :)

## Goals

We know that developers want to invest a lot of time to focus on their day-to-day activities. However, your health can suffer if you don't take a few breaks and exercise. So this app is a way to encourage you to have a healthier attitude at work. :)
